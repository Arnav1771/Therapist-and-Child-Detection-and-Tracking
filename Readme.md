Project Overview
This project utilizes the Ultralytics YOLO model to perform object tracking on a video file. The model used is yolov8m.pt, and the tracking is configured using the bytetrack.yaml configuration file. The primary script for running the analysis is Task.py.

File Structure
bytetrack.yaml
Task.py
yolov8m.pt

bytetrack.yaml: Configuration file for the ByteTrack tracker.
Task.py: Main script to run the YOLO model and perform tracking.
yolov8m.pt: Pre-trained YOLO model weights.
Dependencies
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

Python 3.x
Ultralytics YOLO library
You can install the required library using pip:

Configuration
The bytetrack.yaml file contains the configuration settings for the ByteTrack tracker. Key parameters include:

tracker_type: Type of tracker to use (bytetrack in this case).
track_high_thresh: Threshold for the first association.
track_low_thresh: Threshold for the second association.
new_track_thresh: Threshold for initializing a new track if the detection does not match any tracks.
track_buffer: Buffer to calculate the time when to remove tracks.
match_thresh: Threshold for matching tracks.
fuse_score: Whether to fuse confidence scores with the IoU distances before matching.
Running the Script
To analyze the model predictions and perform tracking, run the Task.py script. The script uses the YOLO model to track objects in the provided video file (Test2.mp4).

Explanation
Model Initialization: The YOLO model is initialized with the pre-trained weights yolov8m.pt.
Tracking: The track method is called on the model with the following parameters:
source: The video file to analyze (Test2.mp4).
show: Whether to display the video with tracking results (True).
tracker: The configuration file for the tracker (bytetrack.yaml).
Reproducing Results
To reproduce the results, follow these steps:

Ensure the project structure is as described above.
Install the required dependencies.
Run the Task.py script.
The script will process the video file Test2.mp4 and display the tracking results using the YOLO model and ByteTrack tracker configuration.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates how to use the Ultralytics YOLO model for object tracking in a video file. By following the steps outlined in this README, you should be able to reproduce the results and understand the logic behind analyzing the model predictions.
